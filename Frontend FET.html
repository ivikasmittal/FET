				The Field Effect Transistor (FET) is a three terminal device. Three terminals are Drain (D), Source (S) and Gate (G). In FET, current flow is due to only one type of charge particles, either electrons or holes. So FET is known as unipolar device. The name ”field effect”  is derived from the fact that the current is controlled by an electric field set up in the device by an externally applied voltage. Thus FET is a voltage controlled device while bipolar transistor is current controlled device.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>The FET differs bipolar transistor in the following important characteristics:-
				<ol class="differences">
					<li>Its operation depends on the flow of majority carriers only. It is therefore a unipolar device (one type of carriers).</li>
					<li>It is simple to fabricate and occupies less space in integrated form.</li>
					<li>It exhibits a high input resistance typically many Mega-ohms.</li>
					<li>It is less noisy than bipolar transistor.</li>
					<li>It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

				In this experiment we will obtain output characteristics of N-channel FET using CS (Common source) Configuration. It is also known as drain characteristics.

				When gate to source voltage VGS is zero, N type channel is open so drain current will flow through it. As we increase negative voltage on the gate terminal, VGS =-1V, -2V, -3V etc., drain current reduces. The reduction in drain current is due to reduction in width of channel. As we increase negative gate voltage, width of depletion region spreads in the channel. Depletion region (generated field due to reverse bias) does not have charge carriers so width of channel will reduce. As we increase negative value of VGS , penetration of depletion region (field) will be more and more due to which channel becomes narrower. At one point drain current reduces to zero when entire channel will be closed due to penetration of depletion region.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The value of VGS at which drain current reduces to zero is called cut-off voltage VGS( off). Normally Drain current reduces to zero at VGS = -Vp. Thus VGS (off) = -Vp where VP is pinch-off voltage. Pinch-off voltage VP is the value of voltage VDS at which drain current becomes constant.
